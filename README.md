### Taking control of my UIKit app Composition [Builder, Factory Methods, App's Entry Point]

**Xcode version:** 14.3

[release/article/decouple-UIKit-composition](https://github.com/wilbarrios/ios-decoupled-app/tree/release/article/decouple-UIKit-composition) In this repository you'll find:

- Completely removed the composition responsibility from our `ViewController`.
- **"Manually"** composed our *app's entry screen*.
- Created generic functions to construct Storyboard based screens.

### iOS Clean architecture? My way on a very simple feature [MVVM, Repository, URLSession, Swift]

**Xcode version:** 13.4.1

[release/article/decoupled-ios-app](https://github.com/wilbarrios/ios-decoupled-app/tree/release/article/decoupled-ios-app) In this repository you'll find:

- An implementation of **MVVM** design pattern, in a very basic way without any Reactive framework.
- A completely decoupled loading system for any source of data with a **Repository** approach.
- A reusable HTTP GET client based on Foundation's loading system **URLSession**.
- An API definition to model the API.
- And more importantly, we have created a decoupled feature that can be isolated, mocked, and tested on each layer.
