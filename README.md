# Having a decoupled iOS Application on a very simple feature

**Xcode version:** 13.4.1

Hello and welcome! 👋 In this repository you'll find:

- An implementation of **MVVM** design pattern, in a very basic way without any Reactive framework.
- A completely decoupled loading system for any source of data with a **Repository** approach.
- A reusable HTTP GET client based on Foundation's loading system **URLSession**.
- An API definition to model the API.
- And more importantly, we have created a decoupled feature that can be isolated, mocked, and tested on each layer.

All of these on a very simple feature: Fetch random Dog 🐕 facts.

And is the base repository for my **first** [article](@medium_article_url), if you want to check it out, visit it and any feedback will be more than welcome! 🙌 and stay tuned 😉.
