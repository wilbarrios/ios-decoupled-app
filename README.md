# Taking control of my UIKit app Composition [Builder, Factory Methods, App's Entry Point]

**Xcode version:** 14.3

Hello and welcome! 👋 In this repository you'll find:

- Completely removed the composition responsibility from our `ViewController`.
- **"Manually"** composed our *app's entry screen*.
- Created generic functions to construct Storyboard based screens.

Based on my prior artcile [iOS Clean architecture? My way on a very simple feature [MVVM, Repository, URLSession, Swift]](https://medium.com/@wil.barriost/ios-clean-architecture-my-way-on-a-very-simple-feature-mvvm-repository-urlsession-swift-678cfe4301f0)

This is the base repository for my [article](todo-article-url), if you want to check it out, visit it and any feedback will be more than welcome! 🙌 and stay tuned 😉.
